Update June 30:

As an extension implementation, we will implement an interior point method solver for small constrained optimization problems.  

Updated project structure:
 
Linear_Search_Implementation/
│
├── src/
│   ├── unconstrained_min.py     # Core unconstrained optimization algorithms
│   ├── constrained_min.py       # NEW: Constrained optimization algorithms
│   └── utils.py                 # Plotting and helper functions
│
└── tests/
    ├── test_unconstrained_min.py  # Unit tests for unconstrained optimization
    ├── test_constrained_min.py    # NEW: Tests for constrained optimization
    └── examples.py                # Objective functions (linear, quadratic, etc.)

In this exercise, we will:

• Implement Line Search minimization with several methods. 

• Test it on some examples and visualize its performance 

• Organize our project and use one of Python’s testing frameworks 

The project structure is as follows:
