In this exercise, we will:

• Implement Line Search minimization with several methods. 

• Test it on some examples and visualize its performance 

• Organize our project and use one of Python’s testing frameworks 

The project structure is as follows:

Linear_Search_Implementation/
│
├── src/
│   ├── unconstrained_min.py
│   └── utils.py
│
└── tests/
    ├── test_unconstrained_min.py
    └── examples.py
